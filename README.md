# Nidium - Tool-kit for writing server, games, desktop software and mobile apps

## Background

In the 1990's it was impossible to picture what the web would become by the year 2014.

Nidium is the first attempt to handle what's coming: the fusion of desktop applications, mobile applications and next-generation webapps.

It is a brand new solution to create and browse next-generation web and server based applications that run on every platform.

Nidium is so simple to use that you can create apps in minutes. Edit your javascript, add your stylesheet and distribute it.
